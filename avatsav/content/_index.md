# Hi, I'm Abhi

This is my personal logbook — a place where I capture thoughts, learnings  and reflections. Here you'll find posts related to programming, cycling, and whatever I'm hyperfocused on at the moment.

I'm curently an Engineering Manager [(former Tech Lead)](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) at [Capmo](https://capmo.com), helping digitize the construction industry.

I'm just getting started here, but I appreciate you stopping by! 👋
